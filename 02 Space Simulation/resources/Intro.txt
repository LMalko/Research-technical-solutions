The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, and to pick the correct fleet of rockets.
*
4 rocket prototypes were designed and the simulation will decide which types to use.
*
U-0
Zero chance of crashing or explosion but very expensive and small cargo.
*
Rocket cost = $150 Million
Rocket weight = 5 Tonnes
Max weight (with cargo) = 7 Tonnes
*
U-1
*
The U-1 Rocket is light weight, agile and pretty safe, but can only carry a total of 18 tonnes of cargo. It costs $60 Million to build and weighs 10 tonnes. It has a slim chance of crashing 
while landing but a bigger chance of exploding when launching, both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried in the rocket.
*
Rocket cost = $100 Million
Rocket weight = 10 Tonnes
Max weight (with cargo) = 18 Tonnes
Chance of launch explosion = 5% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)
Chance of landing crash = 1% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)
*
U-2
*
The U2 Rocket heavier than the U-1 but much safer and can carry a lot more cargo; to a total of 29 tonnes. However, it costs $120 Million to build and weighs 20 tonnes.
 
It has a greater chance of crashing while landing than while launching, but just like the U-1 both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried.
*
Rocket cost = $120 Million
Rocket weight = 18 Tonnes
Max weight (with cargo) = 29 Tonnes
Chance of launch explosion = 4% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)
Chance of landing crash = 8% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)
*
U4-Prototype
Rocket undergoing tests, good price, loads of space. High chances of crashing or explosion.
*
Rocket cost = $150 Million
Rocket weight = 25 Tonnes
Max weight (with cargo) = 40 Tonnes
Chance of launch explosion = 25% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)
Chance of landing crash = 15% * (cargo carried / cargo limit)

THE MISSION
*
The mission consists of 2 phases:
*
Phase-1:
*
This phase is meant to send building equipment and construction material to help build the colony. The list of all items that we need to send and also the item name and its weight in Kgs.
*
building tools=2000
building tools=2000
building tools=2000
building tools=5000
building tools=5000
building tools=2000
building tools=1000
building tools=5000
building tools=6000
shelter equipment=5000
construction equipment=5000
plants=1000
steel=8000
books=1000
water=5000
*
Phase-2:
*
This phase is meant to send the colony of humans along with some food resources. The list of all items that we need to send and also the item name and its weight in Kgs.
*
habitat=3000
colony=5000
food=5000
habitat=3000
colony=5000
food=3000
colony=5000
food=3000
*
Now we will run some simulations and test both rocket types for each phase separately.
